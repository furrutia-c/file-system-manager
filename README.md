# File System Manager
This package for Laravel allows you to connect to an FTP server and efficiently manage files and folders. It provides an intuitive interface for performing common operations such as uploading, downloading, deleting, moving, and renaming files, as well as creating and organizing directories directly from your web application.

## Key Features

- **FTP Connection**: Simplifies connecting to FTP servers for file and folder management.
- **File Management**: Full support for uploading, downloading, renaming, moving, and deleting files.
- **Folder Management**: Easily create, delete, and organize directories.
- **Modern Interface**: Uses **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive design.
